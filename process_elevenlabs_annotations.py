    Process the input data to filter, sort, and combine records into sentences.
    
    Steps:
    1. Filter out records that do not have a type of "spacing" or "word".
    2. Sort the filtered records by the "start" time.
    3. Iterate through the records to build sentences:
       - Start a sentence with the current record's text and record its start time.
       - If the current sentence (after stripping) ends with punctuation ('.', '!', '?'), finish the sentence.
       - Otherwise, append the next record's text and update the end time.
    4. Safety check: When the data ends, if the last sentence doesnâ€™t end with punctuation, still add it.
    5. Final pass: Remove any sentence where the "text" field is exactly a single space " ".
       
    Returns:
      A list of dictionaries, each with the keys "text", "start", and "end".
